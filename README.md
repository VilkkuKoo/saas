SAAS - Sleep As Android Status 


THIS INTEGRATION IS FUNCTIONAL BUT NOT FINISHED!

Built this in less than a week, with no prior knowledge of Python.

When finished this integration will create 6 sensors per user. (x works, O needs work)

x State

x Sound 

x Disturbance

x Alarm Event

x Sleep Tracking

O  Lullaby State

O  Wake Status

This should intelligently and dynamically allow for state changes. As of right now some states work and some don't.
