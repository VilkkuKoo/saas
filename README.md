THIS INTEGRATION IS NOT READY YET!
Some of the features seem to work, and others don't.
Built this in less than a week, with no prior knowledge of Python, using the help of CoPilot.

When finished this integration will create 6 sensors per user.
Wake Status
State
Sound 
Disturbance
Alarm Event
Sleep Tracking

This should intelligently and dynamically allow for state changes. As of right now some states work and some don't. If anyone wants to help I'm open to it.
